# Toolkit

This is the toolkit I use:

1. Windows 10

2. Visual Studio Code

* Plugin ``CMake Tools`` (just manually create ``CMakeLists.txt`` then compile)

**Note**: if doing something more complicated (ex. using Qt) it's better to use an actual IDE like Visual studio or CLion, but Visual studio code is acceptable for this type of project.

3. Debugger is ``cdb``

* For debugger setup see ".vscode/launch.json"
* Then, you can debug directly with Visual Studio Code
